# Viptela-Diagram
This is a Python-Flask based code to generate a diagram of a Cisco SDWAN network (dataplane only) and display the tunnels between the branches. This is based on Cisco's NextUI and
viptelaquery (https://github.com/CiscoSE/viptelaquery). some changes have been made to the original code.
